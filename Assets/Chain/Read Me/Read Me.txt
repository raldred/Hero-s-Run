Physics Chain by Nik Kraus


Adjustments:

Any of the physics or joint controller attributes, on the links, can be adjusted to alter the overall chain reactions. 
To make adjustments, expand the chain parent and select all the links within the Hierarchy view, then in the inspector 
window, change the physics or joint values one at a time.


To Extend the Chain:

In the Hierarchy view, expand the chain parent and select all the chain links. 
Then use the duplicate command “Ctrl D” or in the menu go to Edit > Duplicate. You will now see a new group of chain links selected 
in the Hierarchy and Game View windows. In the Game view, use the move tool to move all the new selected links down to almost below 
the last link and then rotate along the world Y axis 90 degrees until the two parts match up. You will notice that there are two links 
of the same name, you are welcome to rename them if needed. In the Game View select the top link of the new chain section and in the 
inspector window expand the “Character Joint” section. Then from the Hierarchy view drag and drop the top chain link named “ChainLink17” 
into the “connected body” field. Press play and the new extended chain is active.
